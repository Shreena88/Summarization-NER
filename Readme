project:
  name: Summarization + Named Entity Recognition (NER) Dashboard
  description: >
    A local transformer-based Streamlit dashboard where users can choose
    between text summarization and named entity recognition (NER). Users
    input text and get either a concise summary or a list of extracted entities.
    The dashboard loads fine-tuned models for better performance.

structure:
  files:
    - app.py: Main Streamlit application
    - summarization.py: Local transformer-based text summarization module
    - ner_processing.py: NER processing module
    - requirements.txt: Required Python packages
    - utils/: Folder containing fine-tuned models

models:
  summarization:
    name: Fine-tuned Summarization Model
    path: models/summarization_model
    base_model: sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6
    description: >
      A fine-tuned DistilBART model for text summarization.
      Loaded using AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained.

  ner:
    name: Fine-tuned NER Model
    path: models/ner_model
    base_model: distilbert-base-cased
    description: >
      A fine-tuned DistilBERT model for named entity recognition.
      Loaded with number of labels = num_labels.

steps:
  - step: Create and activate virtual environment
    description: >
      Create a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies, then activate it.
    commands:
      - python -m venv venv
      - .\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows PowerShell

  - step: Install dependencies
    description: Install all required Python packages from requirements.txt
    command: pip install -r requirements.txt

  - step: Prepare environment
    description: >
      Ensure fine-tuned models are available locally in the `utils/` folder.

  - step: Start Streamlit dashboard
    description: Launch the interactive web app
    command: streamlit run app.py

  - step: Choose option
    description: >
      In the dashboard, select either "Summarization" or "NER" from the sidebar.

  - step: Summarization (if chosen)
    description: >
      The fine-tuned summarization module processes the text input and returns a concise summary.
    module: summarization.py
    model_path: models/summarization_model

  - step: NER (if chosen)
    description: >
      The fine-tuned NER module identifies named entities (PERSON, ORG, LOC, DATE, etc.)
      from the text input and displays them in a structured format.
    module: ner_processing.py
    model_path: models/ner_model

  - step: Display results
    description: >
      The dashboard shows either the summary or the extracted entities
      depending on the user’s choice.

notes:
  - All processing is local; no external API calls required.
  - Recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.
  - Ensure your fine-tuned models are stored in the `models/` folder.
  - Can be extended to add multi-language support or custom NER/summarization models.
